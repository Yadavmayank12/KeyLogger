# KeyLogger
A keylogger is a type of spyware that secretly records every keystroke you make on your device. It can be used to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and private messages.
🕵️‍♂️ What Keyloggers Do
- Record keystrokes: They log everything you type, including login credentials, emails, chats, and financial data.
- Send data to attackers: The captured information is often transmitted to a remote server controlled by a hacker.
- Operate silently: Keyloggers run in the background without alerting the user, making them hard to detect.
